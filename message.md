Welcome to the International Workshop on Quality Assurance in the Context of Cloud Computing  (QA3C 2018).

One of the key properties of cloud technologies is their promise for scalability, resilience, along with the ability to use many services provided and managed by cloud providers. In recent years, the release of a mature set of technologies enabled the possibility to experiment new concepts and scenarios, however there is still a lack of consolidated methods tackling quality assurance of Cloud solutions by systematically influencing the analysis, the design, and the validation of Cloud-based Platforms and Services. In fact, being able to scale on-demand, or to monitor the status of a virtual resource does not contribute per-se to the quality of a solution. On one side, Cloud-based Platforms and Services might need to be conceived in order to properly ensure desired sets of quality attributes. On the other side, quality enablers tools (e.g. code generators, policy enforcement modules, verification frameworks, testing tools, monitoring and reporting suites) need to be brought to the cloud, and they also need to be aware of the cloud in order to assess target quality aspects. 

Within the context of the QA3C workshop, our intent is to provide a common space for software engineers, cloud analysts, developers, and testers in order to share ideas, perspectives and approaches enabling quality attributes while engineering Cloud-based Platforms and Services. 

Our call for contributions confirmed the interest of several researchers from both Academia, and Industry spanning over different parts of the world. We received submissions covering topics on testing, security, confidentiality, IoT, migration from legacy applications, and also a mapping study on the current literature on cloud services. The overall quality assessment of the received contributions resulted in an set of 5 selected papers. Their presentations and the following Q&A sessions will constitute the core of the program for the QA3C workshop. In addition, we are happy to host in the program a keynote on how "observability" in testing of Cloud-based Platforms and Services can be referred and adopted in actual production systems.

As final remarks, the co-organisers would like to thank all the authors for their contribution, and all the members of the Technical Program Committee for their professional and contructive reviews. Of course we would like to thank the European Project H2020 731535: ElasTest that encouraged and supported our work. Last but not least, we would also thank the organisers of UCC 2018 for the opportunity they gave to all of us in hosting this workshop.

Your co-chairs,
